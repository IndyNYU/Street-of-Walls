Think of interviewing as an opportunity to demonstrate how many skills you have accured in these areas. Do not be upset if
there is some area covered in an interview question that you've never been exposed to-the goal is not demonstrate that you
know everything.

For example, are you being asked to value a customized stock option?
Talk about the valuation framework, and how you might forecast future prices using a Monte Carlo simulation technique.
(What type of drift and volatility process will your simulation incorporate?) Remember that you should be prepared to 
fully detail any concept you mention during a conversation.

Emphaszie any classwork, projects, work or teaching experience that is relevant to the Quant world.
Note that for non-technical questions, it is not just the content of your responses that matters-just as important is the
manner in which you verbalize them.
Some other questions in this area might include:
(1) Tell me something about yourself that is not listed on your resume.
(2) What is the riskiest thing you've ever done?
(3) Are you more risk-averse or risk-seeking?
(4) What is your greatest weakness?
(5) How do you feel about waking up early or staying up late?
(6) What are your interests outside the classroom / office?
(7) Why should we hire you?
(8) What is your favourite class that you took?
(9) Who has personally influenced you the most? Name someone.
(10) Whom you've never met who's been a strong influence.
(11) Tell me about your biggest failure or a period of adversity.
(12) Discuss a difficult ethical decision you recently faced.
(13) What's the last book you read.
