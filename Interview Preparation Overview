You need to be able to think on your feet, and these questions tests that ability.

In the interview, the goal is not to demonstrate you know everything, it is to demonstrate that you know a lot,
and you know how to work with the knowledge that you have.

Keep your answers focused, but include relevant techniques you might incorporate into solving a problem,
and be prepared to explain how you'd use such methods.

Don't be afraid to ask questions.
An intelligent question-whether about how something is modeled, how portfolio risk is calculated,
or how an asset is valued can go a long way to proving that you are the type of employee who will be engaged and
willing to go the extra step to solve unanswered questions or improve an existing process.
