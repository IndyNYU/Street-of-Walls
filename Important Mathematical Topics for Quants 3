Q1. What is an R-square statistic?
A1.

Q2. What is a random walk? Is it stationary or non-stationary?
A2.

Q3. What happens if you create a regression based on 2 variables that each are continuously increasing with time?
A3.

Q4. If I have a regression between X and Y, what test statistics should I look at to determine whether I have a good model?
A4.

Q5. If I have data from 1992-2012, what's the danger if I build a model forecasting values in 2012 using all of the historical data?
A5. Fitting a model with all available data is called in-sample testing. A model can be constructed that may perform exceptionally
    well during a selected period of history, but structural changes over time may mean that a model that worked well in the past
    may not work well in the future. Rather than back-testing a model using in-sample data, create a model that uses some historical
    data and test how well the model works when applied to data that wasn't used to construct the model. While back-testing can provide
    valuable information regarding a model's potential, back-testing alone often produces deceptive results.

Q6. Why should I care about residuals in a regression?
A6. If a plot of residuals versus time does not look like white noise, the model is likely misspecified. Correlation of residuals is
    known as autocorrelation, and can be checked by calculating the Durbin-Watson statistic. With autocorrelation of residuals, the
    estimated regression coefficients are still unbiased but many no longer have the minimum variance among all unbiased estimates
    (they are inefficient); moreover, confidence intervals may be underestimated and estimation of the test statistics for the F-test
    (and so significance) may also be underestimated, potentially leading to the conclusion that the set of explanatory variables is
    not significant as a whole.
